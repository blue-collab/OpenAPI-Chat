This Terms and Conditions only grants you the right to</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 91%;text-align: left;">use the Pharmazing App to benefit from Services within the scope defined herein. You’re not allowed to copy, or modify the Pharmazing App, any part of the Pharmazing App, or our trademarks in</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 91%;text-align: left;">any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the Pharmazing App, and you also should not try to translate the Pharmazing App into other languages, or make derivative versions. The Pharmazing App itself, and all the trademarks, copyright, database rights and other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to Emin Karayel, Goethepark 18, 10627 Berlin, Germany.</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 91%;text-align: left;">Emin Karayel is committed to ensuring that the Pharmazing App is as useful and eﬃcient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the Pharmazing App or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never charge you for the Pharmazing App or its Services without making it very clear to you exactly what you’re paying for. The Pharmazing App stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us, in order to provide our Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the Pharmazing App secure. We therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 91%;text-align: left;">the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the oﬃcial operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean that the Pharmazing App won’t work properly or at all.</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 91%;text-align: left;">You should be aware that there are certain things that Emin Karayel will not take responsibility for. Certain functions of the Pharmazing App will require the Pharmazing App to have an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network provider, but Emin Karayel cannot take responsibility for the Pharmazing App not working at full</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 91%;text-align: left;">functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data allowance left. If you’re using the Pharmazing App outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that your terms of the agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 91%;text-align: left;">while accessing the Pharmazing App, or other third party charges. In using the Pharmazing App, you’re accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 91%;text-align: left;">use the Pharmazing App outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning oﬀ data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re using the Pharmazing App, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission from the bill payer</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">for using the Pharmazing App.</p><p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 91%;text-align: left;">Along the same lines, Emin Karayel cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the Pharmazing App i.e. You need to make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the Emin Karayel Service, Emin Karayel cannot accept responsibility.</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 91%;text-align: left;">With respect to Emin Karayel’s responsibility for your use of the Pharmazing App, when you’re using the Pharmazing App, it’s important to bear in mind that although we endeavor to ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make it available to you. Emin Karayel accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the Pharmazing App.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 91%;text-align: left;">At some point, we may wish to update the Pharmazing App. The Pharmazing App is currently available on iOS and Android – the requirements for system (and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change, and you will need to download the updates if you want to keep using the Pharmazing App. Emin Karayel does not promise that it will always update the Pharmazing App so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the iOS or Android version that you have installed on your device. However, you promise to always</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">accept updates to the application when oﬀered to you. We may also wish to stop providing</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 91%;text-align: left;">the Pharmazing App, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 91%;text-align: left;">granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the Pharmazing App, and (if needed) delete it from your device.</p><p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">User Content</p><p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">You may provide, upload, transmit, create, store, use, edit or share contents such as data, information, phrases, entries, text, question, material with or through Services (<span class="h1">Input</span>); and receive content such as phrases, text, responses created, generated, returned by Services (<span class="h1">Output) </span>(Input and Output are together referred to as <span class="h1">User Content</span>).
